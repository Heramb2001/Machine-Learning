# Smoke Detection using Machine Learning Algorithms

This project explores the use of various machine learning algorithms for smoke detection. The algorithms considered in the analysis include Logistic Regression, KNN Classifier, Adaboost Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, and Gradient Boost Classifier. 

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of features extracted from images captured in smoke-prone environments. Features include (list some of the features).

## Analysis

In the Jupyter Notebook `Smoke_Detection_Analysis.ipynb`, we conducted a comparative analysis of the following machine learning algorithms for smoke detection:
1. KNN Classifier - 97.92% Accuracy
2. Random Forest Classifier - 99.99% Accuracy


## Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the KNN Classifier and Random Forest Classifier exhibited the best performance among the considered algorithms, with the Random Forest Classifier achieving the highest accuracy of 99.99%. These results suggest that the Random Forest Classifier is the most suitable model for smoke detection in this context.

## Notebook Usage

To reproduce the results presented in the analysis, run the Jupyter Notebook `Smoke_Detection_Analysis.ipynb` with the provided dataset.

## Dependencies
